      <h3>Background</h3>
      <p>I'm based in Portland, Oregon and have spent the last five years as a commercial photographer. I have a lot of experience with visual and written content creation, and so I've had some peripheral experience with websites.  </p>
      <h3>Interests, Hobbies, and skills</h3>
      <p>My interests, hobbies, and skills consist of exercise, playing guitar, photography, cooking, and Spanish conversaion. As much as I love computers, I have to balance it out with plenty of analog activies too!</p>
